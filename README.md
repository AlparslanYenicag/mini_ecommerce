# Mini eCommerce

A basic front-end eCommerce site built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, as part of a bootcamp assignment.  
The site allows users to view products, search through them, and simulate adding items to a shopping cart.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was developed to **practice data handling and UI building in vanilla JavaScript**, as well as gain a better understanding of how an eCommerce interface can be structured on the front-end side.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- JSON (local data source)

## 📦 Features

- Product list loaded from external JSON file  
- Search functionality  
- "Add to cart" buttons  
- Cart display (note: limited functionality; known bug with cart display not updating in all cases)

## 🧩 Challenges Faced

While the logic for adding items to the cart worked in the background, the **cart UI did not reflect all added items** until a new search was performed. Debugging dynamic UI updates proved to be more complex than expected and remains a future improvement point.

## 🚀 What I Learned

- How to fetch and render JSON data  
- Creating dynamic DOM elements based on user interaction  
- Structuring a basic front-end shopping experience  
- The importance of properly syncing UI state with logic

## 👀 Why This Project Matters

This was my first attempt at mimicking real-world eCommerce functionality — albeit in a small and imperfect form.  
More than just a bootcamp assignment, it was a step forward in **understanding how JavaScript drives interactivity and data presentation.**
